## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned about background image properties such as background-size and background-repeat, and I also became more familiar with using Flexbox

### Continued development

I'm particularly interested in learning more about advanced CSS properties like grid, flexbox, and animations. These properties can help me create more complex and dynamic designs that are both visually appealing and functional.



### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.php) -This article helped me a lot in understanding the background property in CSS.
